  bio: |
    Throughout her PhD, Céline focused on characterizing and improving the reliability of brain connectivity estimates
      by addressing key sources of variability in MRI-based measurements.
    To mitigate the impact of methodological flexibility in neuroimaging pipelines, she contributed to standardizing
      quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures by developing a comprehensive QA/QC protocol that can be
      easily reused and adapted to other project needs.
    She also helped enhance MRIQC and fMRIPrep, widely used tools that standardize image preprocessing.
    Additionally, she investigated the impact of defacing on perceived image quality, demonstrating that QC procedures
      should ideally be performed before defacing to prevent biased assessments.

    Céline also co-led the acquisition of the Human Connectome Phantom (HCPh) dataset, a large-scale initiative designed to
      systematically assess the reliability of functional and structural connectivity.
    By repeatedly scanning a single individual across multiple scanners, the dataset provides a unique opportunity to
      disentangle between-scanner and within-scanner variability in both functional and diffusion MRI.
    It also serves as a valuable resource for developing improved methods to remove non-neural signal fluctuations in fMRI.

    Now, as a Research Engineer, Céline is finalizing the analysis of the HCPh dataset and preparing it for public
      sharing, further supporting the lab’s efforts to promote open science and reproducibility in MRI research.

  bio: |
    My background is in Astrophysics. During my PhD, I developed deep-learning tools to classify, segment and generate images.
    In addition to a machine learning core, my PhD research involved a substantial amount of image processing.
    In The AxonLab, I contribute to implementing preprocessing tools under the umbrella of the [*NiPreps* ecosystem](https://nipreps.org) to improve computational reproducibility and reduce methodological variability in MRI research.
    In addition to this, I am strongly committed to promoting open science.

  bio: |
    Alexandre Cionca is a research assistant in the Department of Radiology at the University Hospital of
    Lausanne (CHUV).
    He graduated from EPFL with a specialization in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).
    He focused his studies on data science and statistical learning applied to the neuroimaging field.
    He then joined the Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology lab ([CENLab](https://cenlab.ch)) at the
    University of Geneva, where he worked on all-around data processing and analysis for the
    [COVID-COG](https://unige.ch/fapse/cenlab/research/ongoing-projects/ff) project.
    His research included computational modeling of functional MRI in the unraveling of long-term
    neuropsychological effects following a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
    He is now fulfilling his civil service with the Axon Lab in an initiative to evaluate
    the reliability of the clinical MRI workflow that routinely aids medical decision at CHUV.
