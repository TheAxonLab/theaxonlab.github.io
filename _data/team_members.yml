  bio: |-
    Oscar Esteban is an [Associate Professor](https://people.hes-so.ch/en/profile/11550212653-oscar-esteban)
    at the School of Engineering, HES-SO Valais-Wallis, 
    and a long-standing advocate for open and reproducible neuroimaging.
    He leads the AxonLab, which develops open, analysis-grade neuroimaging
    infrastructure to make human and nonhuman MRI applications more reliable,
    comparable and easier to share. He is best known as a founder and co-lead
    developer of the NiPreps ecosystem ([www.nipreps.org](https://www.nipreps.org)),
    including tools such as *fMRIPrep*, *MRIQC*, and
    [*TemplateFlow*](https://www.templateflow.org), which
    have become standard components of many neuroimaging workflows
    and embody FAIR and open-science principles.
  
    His research programme focuses on the reliability and interpretability of
    MRI-based measures of brain connectivity across structural, functional, and
    diffusion MRI, and on integrating MRI with positron emission tomography
    (PET), with a long-term vision of uncovering the interplay of structure,
    function, and dynamics using neuroimaging. Through the [Human Connectome
    PHantom (HCPh) study](https://www.axonlab.org/hcph-sops) and other 
    dense-sampling paradigms, his group uses repeated multi-session MRI
    to characterise measurement variability, calibrate quality assessment
    and preprocessing pipelines, and benchmark connectivity metrics.
    Methodologically, the AxonLab operates at the interface of neurocomputing,
    neuroimaging, and neuroinformatics, treating analysis workflows as modular,
    optimizable software systems and exploring machine-learning and
    differentiable programming approaches to build adaptive preprocessing
    and QA/QC pipelines that remain transparent and reproducible,
    with an emphasis on standardizing workflows and reaching
    consensus implementations that reduce methodological variability.
  
    At HES-SO Valais-Wallis, he contributes to Bachelor's and Master's teaching at
    the interface of neuroimaging, data science, and artificial intelligence,
    bringing real-world open-source tools and datasets into the classroom. He
    also serves as Secretary-Elect of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping
    (OHBM), is an Editorial Board Member of Scientific Data, will initiate
    a Registered Reports track at Aperture Neuro as Special Editor in 2026,
    and is a working group member of *INDoS* (*Improving Neuroimaging Data for Sharing*;
    [COST Action CA24161](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA24161/)).
    As part of his commitment to community standards, he is an active contributor
    to the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
    and related initiatives.
  
    Through these software, standards, and service activities, Oscar works to
    advance an open-science ecosystem for neuroimaging that couples robust,
    standardized QA/QC procedures with interoperable data formats and
    ethically grounded data governance. His goal is to enable reliable reuse
    of neuroimaging data across studies, sites, and modalities, so that
    methodological advances translate into more trustworthy inferences about
    brain organization and function.
